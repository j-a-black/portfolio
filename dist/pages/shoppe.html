        <h2>Purpose and Objectives</h2>
        <p>
          The purpose of this project was to explore how to traverse the DOM,
          update and delete information within a shopping, and to craft a
          website layout based on a landing page design. My objectives were to:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Add items to the cart by utilizing for loops to iterate through a
            collection of class names and adding event listeners
          </li>
          <li>
            Remove items from the cart by developing a familiarity with
            selecting a parent element and removing all children nodes
          </li>
          <li>Utilize open source for website layout designs</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>
          Running a for loop that displays the numbers one through 10 is very
          straight forward compared to using a for loop to iterate through a
          collection of class names, then adding event listeners to each
          element, and subsequently using a high order function – like the
          addEventListener – to pass another function as an argument. This
          required research, trial and error, and plenty of console logs.
        </p>
        <p>
          This process alone was very important to understand as it played an
          instrumental role in adding items to a cart, removing items from a
          cart, and updating the total price.
